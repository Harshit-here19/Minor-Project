                        <p>The Agra Fort is a historical fort also known as the Red Fort. Built by the Mughal emperor
                            Akbar in 1565 and completed in 1573, it served as the main residence of the rulers of the
                            Mughal Dynasty until 1638. It was also known as the “Lal-Qila”, “Fort Rouge” or
                            “Qila-i-Akbari”.Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it
                            were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was life inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage
                            Site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The
                            fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.</p>

                            main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the
                            Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally
                            red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed
                            the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and
                            combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>

                            kilometres from the district headquarters of Agra,Fatehpur Sikri itself was founded as the
                            capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when
                            Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610.
                            The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot
                            before.</p>
